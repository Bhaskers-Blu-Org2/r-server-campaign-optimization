When a business launches a marketing campaign to interest customers in some new or existing product(s), they will typically use  a set of  business rules to select leads for their campaign.  Machine learning can be used to help increase the response rate from these leads.   This solution package shows how to use a prediction model to increase the response rate to a campaign by recommending  <strong>how to contact</strong> (for example, e-mail, SMS, or cold call) as well as <strong>when to contact</strong> (day of week and time of day) each lead identified for use in a new campaign.
