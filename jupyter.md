## Using a Jupyter Notebook

You can view and execute the R code for this solution in a Jupyter Notebook on the VM by following these instructions. 

## Set Password and Start

On the VM desktop, you will see an icon "Jupyter Set Password...".  Double click this icon and follow the prompts to create a password and then start the Jupyter server.  

HINT: If the window is too small, click on the icon on the upper left corner and use the Properties dialog to enlarge the font size.
       
## Access Jupyter

Once the server is running, open the Mozilla Firefox web browser.  Type 

    https://localhost:9999

into the address bar to access Jupyter. 

 There are a number of samples available on the VM server.  To add the Campaign Optimization solution, use the `Upload` button and navigate to the **Desktop\Campaign\R** folder where you will see the **Campaign Optimization R Notebook**.
